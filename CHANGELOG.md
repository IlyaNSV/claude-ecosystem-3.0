## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-18

Initial release. Includes 12 architectural modifications applied to baseline design (10 iterations of design from 2026-04-17).

### Added — Ceremony reduction

- **A1: Confidence-gated auto-approve for 🟢 Confirmation artifacts**
  Derived artifacts (LC, VC, RPM, NM) auto-transition to active when AI marks `confidence: high` AND all V-* validations pass. Human gets notification, can revert. Reduces approve-clicks by ~40% per feature.
- **A2: Batch approve in Discovery for 🟡 Standard artifacts**
  G2 (MR), G3 (CA) replaced with "Discovery Review Checkpoint" after D1.4. G1 (PS), G4 (SEG), G4a (VP), G5 (HYP) remain per-item.
- **A3: Magnitude-gated DA review (P-RULE-01/02 modified)**
  DA required only for: creation, severity change, semantic statement change, parameter type change, category change. Cosmetic edits skip. Skipped DAs accumulate as "DA debt" — batched at next FM-level approve gate.

### Added — Validation tiering

- **B1: Project validation tier (`pilot | mvp | full`)**
  Configured in `.claude/product.yaml`. Pilot tier runs only 🔴 Blocking inline; 🟡 Warning queued in `/product:status`. Reduces noise during early iterations.
- **B2: Quiet draft hooks**
  Hooks (BG extraction, cascade check, validation) execute on draft saves but queue results without surfacing. Results shown at draft→active transition or `/product:status`.

### Added — Drift detection

- **C1: `/product:drift-check` command**
  On-demand structural self-audit. Reads PS + active HYP primary + MVP scope + last 10 changed artifacts. Returns direction alignment report (green/yellow/red).
- **C2: `confidence:` field in all artifact frontmatter**
  Required field: `confidence: high | medium | low` + optional `confidence_notes:`. Forces AI self-assessment at approve. Ties into A1 auto-approve.
- **C3: `/product:meta-feedback` command**
  AI can propose ecosystem-level changes (e.g., "rule V-07 generates false positives — propose downgrade"). Logged in decision journal with rationale.
- **C4: `/product:patterns` meta-linter**
  On-demand analysis of `.product/` for recurring anti-patterns (hard-coded values across BR, missing actors in SC, asymmetric FM dependencies, etc.). Informational, not blocking.

### Added — Flexibility

- **D1: Handoff tiers (`draft | production`)**
  `--mode draft` flag relaxes DoR to 3 minimum blockers (FM in-progress, ≥1 SC active, BG covers terms). Generates with `status: partial` + warnings. `--mode production` (default) retains full 8-blocker DoR.
- **D2: `approve_overrides` per artifact with mandatory rationale**
  Human can override blocking V-* rule per artifact via frontmatter. Rationale required, logged in decision journal. Visible in `/product:validate` as known overrides (not failures).
- **D3: NOTE-* unstructured artifact type (22nd type)**
  Catch-all for idea-capture, insights, "think later". Minimal frontmatter (id, title, status, related). Not in dependency graph, not validated by V-*. Convertible to other types via `/product:promote-note <NOTE-id> to <TYPE>`.

### Modified

- **Total artifact types: 21 → 22** (added NOTE-*).
- **Validation rules count remains 33** (33 V-*) + 2 process rules. Behavior changed via tiering (B1) and quiet mode (B2), not rule additions.
- **`approve_overrides` field added to common frontmatter schema** (in `pmo/artifacts/README.md`).

### Documentation structure

- Migrated from previous design location (`PMO Ecosystem/Ecosystem 3.0/`) to clean repo `claude-ecosystem-3.0/`.
- Moved SPECs into `docs/` subdirectory to reflect clean separation: SPECs (reference) vs runtime artifacts (commands, skills, agents, hooks).
- Removed design history files (`_decisions/`, audit reports, chat artifacts) — they belong to design archive, not operational ecosystem.

---

## Future versions (planned)

- **v1.1** — Orchestrator Module concept + `/product:patterns` pattern dictionary expansion based on real usage data.
- **v1.2** — `P3 Feedback Integration` activation when D5 tooling is available via Integrator.
- **v2.0** — Multi-product workspace support; `P5 Actuality Refresh` automation when usage data shows real refresh patterns.

## Reference: Design history (NOT in this repo)

Full design history (10 iterations from audit through 4 modules) is preserved in author's design archive. This repo contains only the operational ecosystem.
